# Computational-physics-
The aim of this project is to provide Python codes for all exercises in the book **Computational physics by Mark-newman**. 
Each chapter is written using **google colab** as a jupyter notebook so that you can run it directly in google colab.

Here are the contents of the book 

### Chapter 1: Introduction
Chapter 1 has no exercises and therefore is not featured in this project. The chapter aims to introduce the reader to the underlying concepts that will be covered in the rest of the book.

### Chapter 2: Python programming for physicists
Chapter 2 introduces different concepts of python programming from variable assignments to user-defined functions and regression methods of calculation. Exercises in this chapter are focused on problem-solving and the translation of mathematical equations and physics concepts into code. From problems that cover 2-D kinematics and altitude of satellite orbits to calculating binomial coefficients using "n choose k" with Pascal's Triangle and programming recursive solutions and calculating prime numbers.

### Chapter 3: Graphics and visualization
Chapter 3 introduces methods of data visualization that include graphs, density plots 3-D visualization and Animation.

### Chapter 4: Accuracy and speed
Chapter 4 deals with the limitations of the computer. This chapter deals with methods to estimate the accuracy of calculations and how long it would take to compute solutions depending on the number of steps needed.

### Chapter 5: Integrals and derivatives
Chapter 5 is the first look at computational physics proper with methods for performing integrals and derivatives. The techniques covered include the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule and more advanced methods such as adaptive methods including Romberg integration, and Gaussian quadrature. Some of the applications the author uses for the exercises are heat capacity of solids, thermal radiation, electrostatics calculations, and image processing. 

### Chapter 6: Solutions to linear and nonlinear equations
Chapter 6, as the title suggests, deals with linear and non-linear systems of equations and how to find solutions through a range of different methods. These methods include simultaneous linear equations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, non-linear equations treatment, and maxima and minima of functions.

### Chapter 7: Fourier transforms
Chapter 7 is focused on topics dealing with the Fourier series such as discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine and sine transform, and fast Fourier transforms.

### Chapter 8: Ordinary differential equations
Chapter 8 as the title suggests this chapter focuses on techniques to solve first-order differential equations with one variable, differential equations with more than one variable, second-order differential equations, the variation of step size, and boundary value problems.

### Chapter 9: Partial differential equations
Chapter 9 builds on the concepts seen in chapter 8 but this time the focus is on methods to solve partial differentials. These include relaxation methods and initial value problems. 

### Chapter 10: Random processes and Monte Carlo methods
Chapter 10 focuses on randomness and random processes and how they can be used to solve problems in physics. The methods covered in the chapter include: random numbers generators, seeds, secrete codes, and Gaussian random numbers to name a few; Monte Carlo integration method; Monte Carlo Simulation, Markov chain, and simulation annealing.

### Chapter 11: Using what you have learned
Chapter 11 has no exercises and therefore is not featured in this project. The chapter aims to provide the reader with topics for further reading and studying.
